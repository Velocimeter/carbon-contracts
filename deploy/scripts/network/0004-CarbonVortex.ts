 * deploy a new instance of carbon vortex v2.0 with the following configuration:

 * 1. target token is *targetToken* - set address in named-accounts VortexNamedAccounts for the chain
 * 2. final target token is *finalTargetToken* - set address in named-accounts VortexNamedAccounts for the chain (can be zero address)
 * 3. transferAddress is *transferAddress* - set address in named-accounts VortexNamedAccounts for the chain
 *    --- this is the address that will receive the target / final target tokens after trade
 * 4. CarbonController is set as withdraw address (on execute, tokens will be withdrawn from it
 * 5. For licensed deployments, vault should be address 0 (already configured)
